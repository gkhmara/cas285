            <li class="slide showing">Amanda has been walking our dog, Finn, for about a year and we love her. Finn is always stoked to see her! It's not just a daily walk around the neighborhood; they go on fun adventures to Forest Park on the regular. Amanda is dependable and trust worthy and I would recommend her to anyone!<br />&mdash;Susanna T.</li>
            <li class="slide">Amanda has been walking my dog Sam, a 10 pound chihuahua/terrier mix, for 2 years now. Amanda has been very accommodating with my unpredictable schedule. I trust her entirely! She takes such great care if Sam and even has a pet name for her "Samburger". I highly recommend amanda for your pups needs. She's trustworthy, punctual and thoughtful.<br />&mdash;Jessica Needham</li>
            <li class="slide">My experience with Amanda has been great! I knew she was a good match for my family when she met my sensitive Border Collie mix, Rua. Rua was very comfortable with her extremely quickly; a rare thing!  Amanda has been reliable and understanding, I absolutely recommend her if you are looking for help with your pets.<br />&mdash;Timothy Rice</li>
            <li class="slide">This is a wonderful service!  Amanda is very personable, and she walks multiple dogs at once! The socialization is great for my little dogs because one can be a punk. My dogs are improving so much because of these experiences. Wild at Heart is very reasonably priced, punctual, and dependable. And they are super nice and definitely dog people. If you need dog walkers, sitters, etc. you really don't need to stress; this is the way to go!<br />&mdash;Goldyn, Vinny and Carmen</li>
            <li class="slide">I have a bit of a high strung dog that needed more attention than I could provide, so I am very happy I found Wild at Heart. After a few weeks of Amanda walking Tito, he has mellowed out a ton. She has a wealth of knowledge, patience, and understanding for animals. She also provided me with information on how to manage his anxious behavior, which has helped tremendously. Plus, she runs dogs; unfortunately Tito is too old but I still think that's pretty awesome!<br />&mdash;Becca and Tito</li>
